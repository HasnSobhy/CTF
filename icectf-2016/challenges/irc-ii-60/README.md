Here it is, the last challenge of the CTF about IRC. The first write-up is here:
[IRC I (Misc)](https://github.com/nbrisset/CTF/tree/master/icectf-2016/irc-i-35)

Once again, we have to return to their IRC server, in order to ~~trick~~ politely ask the bot to give us the flag.

The "help" command has been removed because of a known bug,
where too many requests to the bot make it quiet a long time.
Instead, we are given the output from !help. In a split second,
the right command to use is quite obvious: `00:22 <IceBot> FLAG flag`

Using the !flag command in the main channel is unconclusive because IceBot only replies to private messages.

```
20:20 Blinils (~Blinils@-censoredIP-.bc.googleusercontent.com) has joined the channel
20:20 Blinils !flag
20:20 +IceBot I'm sorry, you're not a channel operator
```

Unfortunately, if we send a private message to the bot, it will return an error.

I used https://chat.icec.tf and clicked on "IceBot" in order to send it private messages.

In this way, I can send `!flag` instead of `/msg IceBot !flag`

```
21:21  Blinils  !flag 
21:21  IceBot   KeyError: Identifier('Blinils') 
                (file "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sopel/module.py", line 321, in guarded)  
```

A quick search of "sopel/module.py" provides us
[a Github repository](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/blob/master/sopel/module.py),
dedicated to Sopel IRC Bot.

According to the code near line 321, the error above means that we don't have sufficient permissions to ask for the flag.

```
314    def require_privilege(level, message=None):
315         """Decorate a function to require at least the given channel permission.
316        
317         `level` can be one of the privilege levels defined in this module. If the
318         user does not have the privilege, `message` will be said if given. If it is
319         a private message, no checking will be done."""
```

Since the organizers won't let each player become an op
on the main channel (even for a few seconds) we have to do it differently.
Two things: 1# when a user creates and joins a channel,
he automatically becomes op and 2# a user
[can invite another user](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459#section-4.2.7)
to an arbitrary channel.

So the solution is to create a channel, ecome op on it,
then invite IceBot and ~~politely ask it~~ trick it into giving us the flag.

```
[/join #omeca]
23:23    Blinils (~Blinils@-censoredIP-.bc.googleusercontent.com) has joined the channel
23:23    #omeca sets mode +nt
[/invite IceBot #omeca]
23:23    IceBot (~IceBot@-censoredIP-.bc.googleusercontent.com) has joined the channel
23:23    @Blinils !flag
23:23    IceBot IceCTF{H3Re_y0U_9O_M4s7Er_m4kE_5uR3_yOU_K33P_iT_54F3}
```
