ctf8.zip contains the compressed virtual machine target (ctf8.vmdk) as well as 
the PDF walk through instructions.

The latest release fixes some issues with the user cron jobs that check their 
mail.  Earlier versions were prone to memory leaks that would cause the virtual
machine to crash unexpectedly.
