Note that ctf5.ova is the complete image.  ctf5.zip contains the 
instructions but the cron jobs in the virtual target machine are 
not set properly.

This is the fifth capture the flag exercise.  It includes the target virtual
virutal machine image as well as a PDF of instructions.  The username 
and password for the targer are deliberately not provided!  The idea of 
the exercise is to compromise the target WITHOUT knowing the username
and password.  Note that there are other capture the flag exercises.  If
you like this one, download and try out the others.  If you have any 
questions e-mail me at justin@madirish.net
