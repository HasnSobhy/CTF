Updated to set default runlevel to 3 (no X windows) and fixed DHCP.

This is the fourth capture the flag exercise. It includes the target virtual virutal machine image as well as a PDF of instructions. The username and password for the targer are deliberately not provided! The idea of the exercise is to compromise the target WITHOUT knowing the username and password. Note that there are other capture the flag exercises. If you like this one, download and try out the others. If you have any questions e-mail me at justin@madirish.net.
